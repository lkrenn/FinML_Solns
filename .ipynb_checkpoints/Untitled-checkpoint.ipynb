    "\n",
    "There are many firms that are making a transition from discretionary investments to ML-led investments. A notable example is the growth of Point72's systematic investing business, Cubist Systematic Strategies. Given the extensive growth of Cubist in the past years, I can assume that Point72 has succeeded in that venture. \n",

    "The cultural differences between quantitative and fundamental investing are vast: quantitative strategies require collaboration in research whereas fundamental portfolio managers perform better when they are siloed.\n",

    "(#ToDo) I'm not sure what the most important problem in mathematical finance is? \n",

    "## Question 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that the reallocation of assets can be attributed to the idea that quantitative strategies can provide a level of diversification that perhaps cannot be achieved by fundamental shops. While quantitative strategy returns ebb and flow like fundamental returns, they can do so in a way that is orthogonal to their fundamental counterparts.

    "According to this article by Man Group, in 2017, quantitative funds manage approximately 34% of the total hedge fund AUM (https://www.man.com/maninstitute/how-to-pick-a-quantitative-hedge-fund). I will need to find a more updated report to get a better idea of the results 4 years later. In 2020, quant managers were underrepresented in the rich list. "
